<h1>About Schema.org</h1>
    <p>
Schema.org is a collaborative, community activity with a mission to create,
maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet. In addition
to people from the sponsoring companies, there is  substantial participation by the
larger web community, through public mailing lists such as <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-vocabs/">public-vocabs@w3.org</a> and
through <a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg">GitHub</a>. 
 </p>

<p>Since April 2015, the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/schemaorg">Schema.org Community Group</a> is the main forum for schema collaboration, and provides the 
<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-schemaorg/">public-schemaorg@w3.org</a> mailing list for discussions. Schema.org issues are tracked 
<a href="http://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues">on GitHub</a>.</p>

 <p>
    The day to day operations of Schema.org, including decisions regarding the schema, are handled by a steering group,
    which includes representatives of the sponsor companies, the W3C and some individuals
    who have contributed substantially to Schema.org. Discussions of the steering group
    are public.
