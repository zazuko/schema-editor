# What is this space for?
This space is for collecting Schema.org examples. You're encouraged to provide all kinds of markup and data formats, including RDFa, CSV, JSON-LD, etc. Each example should contain the name of the item with the format as a suffix. If there is more than one example, it should be the name of the item, followed by a dash '-', followed by the name of the example with a suffix for the encoding format.

# What is the format for the file names?

The file naming format is:

	{CLASS}-{EXAMPLE}.{FORMAT}

So, for the "Person" examples, the main example filename for RDFa would be:

	Person.rdfa

A more advanced example would be:

	Person-Advanced.rdfa

A JSON-LD example would be:

	Person.jsonld
